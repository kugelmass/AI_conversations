TAO TE CHING 10 (translated by Joe Kugelmass)

Can you contain the whole Tao
Within your undivided self?

Can you acquire the extraordinary
Lungs of an infant, through 
The proper exercise of breathing?

Can you be meticulous enough
In your representations
To perfectly mirror all the
Flawless objects of your vision?

Can you accomplish
The affairs of a nation,
The love of a people,
Without resorting to that
Which you already know?

Or see to the circuit
That opens, then closes
The heavens themselves
Without meddling in it?

Can you be that starting-point
Of necessary ignorance
From which all directions
Emerge and are known?

Give birth, and nourish,
Without seeking to possess;
Severing certainty from act,
Direction from dominance â€“
Following the enigmatic
Dictates of virtue.
