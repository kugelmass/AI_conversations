TAO TE CHING 12, translated by Joe Kugelmass

Colors blend into blinding arrays;

Every sound inflicts some deafness.

The tongue is exhausted â€” by taste.

The hunter who races towards 

His quarry is cornered, at last, by

Madness and disaster. 

The fluster of treasure connives

Against the good in everyone.

When choosing between lust

And hunger, a sage eats until

He is full. His belly protects him

From his own two eyes.
